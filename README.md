In this forked repository there is the code related to book "Learning Concurrent Programming in Scala" by Aleksandar Prokopec

I have included into test folder my personal solution for some of exercises proposed into book. 

Some points are necessary to focus on :
1. These are my personal solution so I can have missundestood an my code can be buggy or diverge respect asked implementation
2. I am using TDD during solution implementation
3. I am using for testing concurrent code the Scalacheck library by Rickard Nilsson
4. Comment and suggestion are welcome!
